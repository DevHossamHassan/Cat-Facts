### Cat-Facts

Cat-Fact's architecture is based on the Clean architecture principles.
(MVP architecture) Model View Presenter

I wrote Unit tests for presenters and UI tests for the views

I'm also one of the Fragment Navigation Pattern fans,
for Centralize the navigation management and for a better means of
communication between screens
